#IT310Final

For my final, I took inspiration from my ballet company's rehearsal schedule as it is only ever distributed in paper form. I thought I can utilize my diagramming knowledge I have acquired this quarter to plan out a hypothetical online calendar that can be shared and distributed virtually rather than physically. 


In this repo, there is my UML class diagram, ERD, and UI wireframes of some basic pages to outline a rough foundation of how I would go about creating a webpage like this. Obviously, this idea can be expanded upon exponentially, adding more features and concepts, but this is a representation of this webpage in its most basic form. See documentation file for further description.
